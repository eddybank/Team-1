FM-Solitare is our code.

K-Solitaire is the master file with a few changes:
  - playNewGame() is public
  - playNewGame() has the previous main() class incorporated so that it creates a new JFrame everytime the game button is clicked
  - the action on close of the JFrame is now DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE rather than EXIT_ON_CLOSE because it would close all open JFrames
  
  We will use SolitareMenu.java to facilitate the the different game types and potentially the personal records of users.
